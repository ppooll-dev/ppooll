alt-preset clicking -- feature requests::

on click full preset of clicked slot 
only interpolate when dragging.
do not recall empty presets (stop if empty OR go to next stored.)
dragging vertical: interpolation between none-neighbour slots?
(ramp or dragging with active_store is maybe too exotic,
but it would need to active_set both slots ....)


presets and active_store need to be inactive (always)
this could be checked (and reset) in ll.pattr_v8
on any click ?



and get a high priority

default priorities !!!
act
ll.blues (force ll.blues varname?)
