alt-preset clicking -- feature requests::

on click full preset of clicked slot 
only interpolate when dragging.
do not recall empty presets (stop if empty OR go to next stored.)
dragging vertical: interpolation between none-neighbour slots?
(ramp or dragging with active_store is maybe too exotic,
but it would need to active_set both slots ....)


presets and active_store need to be inactive (always)
this could be checked (and reset) in ll.pattr_v8
on any click ?

actmake: actmake: No such object
in many help-files etc.
we need a wrapper, that does an update here.

(don't) showtoolbar at open setter


and get a high priority

default priorities !!!
act
ll.blues (force ll.blues varname?)

sort inputs in ppooll_state
in always first !!

factory tetris on savebang only for acts, not for others like helpfiles etc
