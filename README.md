<h2>known issues:</h2>
probably many ðŸ˜…
<h2>development guidelines:</h2>
<h3>todo before creating a ppooll act:</h3> 
<li>avoid redundancy: check if there is already another act that does (exactly) what yours does.</li>
if yes, see if you can extend an existing act before creating a new one. check back with the original authors / the developer team first.</li>
<li>quality over quantity :)</li>

<h3>ppooll styleguide:</h3>
<li>use ll_number objects as ui where possible instead of regular number boxes or sliders and dials</li>
<li>use ppooll preset field instead of max presets</li>
<li>put all processing into subpatch where possible</li>
<li>use ll.r, ll.p or ll.mc.r~ receives instead of regular max receives.</li>
<li>make patches as cable-less as possible</li>
<li>make patches mc-ready if possible</li>
<li>choose unique name for act to avoid conflict with existing externals / patchers</li>
<li>try to save screen estate by making patcher window reasonably small<br />
(tip: tetris helps with organizing ui)</li>
<li>keep ui clean (loook out for ophaned elements in the back)</li>
<li>recommendation: group elements by color</li>

<h3>todo before committing a ppooll act:</h3>
<li>include help file</li>
<li>include authorship and license information</li>
<li>review included code for their license. if the license conflicts with ours (mit license -> link) remove externals from ppooll repository and include them as link in xxxx</li>
<li>add act description to act_overview.json</li>
